######BOOLEANS
#simply TRUE or FALSE
#Almost all values are true except for these ones
#bool(False)
# bool(None)
# bool(0)
# bool("")
# bool(())
# bool([])
# bool({})

#even if you have something returning any of these values in your function you get the result as false.

# Membership operators
# Bitwise operators

###ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
# Operator	Name	           Example	
# +	        Addition           	x + y	
# -	        Subtraction	        x - y	
# *	        Multiplication	    x * y	
# /	        Division	        x / y	
# %	        Modulus         	x % y	(REMAINDER)
# **     	Exponentiation	    x ** y	x = 2  y = 5  print(x ** y) #same as 2*2*2*2*2
# //	    Floor division	    x // y   (ROUNDS DOWN TO THE NERAREST WHOLE NUMBER)


####Python Assignment Operators
# Operator	Example	         Same As	
#  =	    x = 5	        x = 5	
# +=	    x += 3	        x = x + 3	
# -=	    x -= 3	        x = x - 3	
# *=	    x *= 3	        x = x * 3	
# /=	    x /= 3	        x = x / 3	
# %=	    x %= 3	        x = x % 3	
# //=	    x //= 3	        x = x // 3	
# **=	    x **= 3	        x = x ** 3	
# &=	    x &= 3	        x = x & 3	
# |=	    x |= 3	        x = x | 3	
# ^=	    x ^= 3	        x = x ^ 3	
# >>=	    x >>= 3	        x = x >> 3	
# <<=	    x <<= 3	        x = x << 3	
# :=	   print(x := 3)	   x = 3
#                             print(x)

####Comparison Operator
# Operator     	Name	              Example	
# ==	       Equal                	x == y	
# !=	     Not equal              	x != y	
# >	       Greater than             	x > y	
# <	        Less than	                x < y	
# >=	 Greater than or equal to	    x >= y	
# <=	Less than or equal to	        x <= y

#### Logical Operators
# Operator	Description	                                                      Example
# and 	    Returns True if both statements are true	                  x < 5 and  x < 10	
# or	    Returns True if one of the statements is true	              x < 5 or x < 4	
# not	    Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	not   (x < 5 and x < 10)

####Identity Operators
#Operator	    Description	                                                  Example	
# is 	    Returns True if both variables are the same object	              x is y	
# is not	Returns True if both variables are not the same object	          x is not y

####membership operators
# Operator	Description	                                            Example	
# in 	    Returns True if a sequence with the specified
#             value is present in the object	                     x in y	
# not in	Returns True if a sequence with the 
#            specified value is not present in the object	         x not in y
